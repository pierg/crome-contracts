# crome-contracts

Contract Algebra Implementation with behaviours expressed in LTL

[Contract for System Design](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-0o0757488/file/RR-8147.pdf)

## Dependencies

Clone crome-logic from git in the same folder where crome-web is located

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pierg/crome-logic.git
```

Append it to PYTHONPATH

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:../crome-logic/
```


## Installation

We use
[conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) to
manage the environment and dependencies.

We use [pdm](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) to manage 'development'
dependencies (e.g. linting, type checking).


You need to install `conda-merge` so that we can merge all the dependecies from the other repositories and create the `environment.yml`
```bash
pip install conda-merge
```

Once `conda-merge` is installed, you can create the `envioronment.yml` file, create the environment and activate it by runnin the following commands:
```bash
make conda-create
make conda-install
make conda-activate
```

Install the other dependencies with pdm (optional):

```bash
pdm install
```


## Docker

You can directly run the project by running the docker image on any platform

`docker run -it --platform linux/x86_64 pmallozzi/crome-contracts:latest`

### Building the image
